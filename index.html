        <h3>\(Review\ of\ Fluid\ Mechanics\ -\ 1\)</h3>
        The need to review Fluid Mechanics:
        <ul>
            <li>Convection is heat transfer in the presence of fluid flow.</li>
            <li>Fluid Flow affects heat transfer.</li>
            <li>We need to detrmine pressure drop or drag force in a situation of convection heat transfer</li>
        </ul>
        We are exprcted to be familiar width:
        <ul>
            <li>Governing Equations of fluid flow</li>
            <li>Determination of pressure drop when a fluid flows in a duct(internal flow).</li>
            <li>Determination of drag force when fluid flows around a body immersed in it (external flow).</li>
            <li>Laminar and turbulent flow</li>
        </ul>
        Governing Equations of Fluid Flow
        These equations represent
        <ul>
            <li>Conservation of mass</li>
            <li>Conservation of momentum (Newton's second law of motion)</li>
        </ul>
        Also conservation of mass and momentum themselves are not sufficient to solve fluid problems, and we need subsidiary relations to solve these problems. So we use Stokes relation between stress and rate of strain. Notable point is that when we talk about Stokes equation, we restrict ourselves to the Netwonian fluid.
        The resulting equations are known as Navier-Stokes equations. These consist of 
        <ul>
            <li>An equation for conservation of mass, called the equation of continuity</li>
            <li>Equation for conservation of each component of momentum</li>
        </ul>
